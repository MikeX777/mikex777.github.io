            Her - Emotionally Cognizant
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="body1" align="justify" gutterBottom>
            I watched the film Her for the first time this past week and I thought it was excellent, I cannot get some of the ideas in it out of my head. I believe they did an excellent job truly considering the scenario they sought to make, and in addition they were sure to build characters that were in touch with their emotions, and comfortable with being vulnerable. Joaquin Phoenix was not only dynamic, but nailed the portrayal. His acting was a delight to watch, and the chacter felt flawed and real.

            More than that I think they created a deeply moving perspective of human relationships. The ins and outs of a relationship seem to be one of the main points in common throughout the story. Starting off with the character that seems to be alone, but we cannot really tell they are lonely. There is a early sex scene over voice chat that I think it made to alienate the character from other humans. We learn he used to have a romantic relationship with someone, but we do not know much about it, assuming negative feelings about it. And then the OS is introduced and immediately he is enamored with her, at least in seeking to understand way. Shortly as we are getting to know the OS, she recommends trying to go out on a date, and helps him to do so. Even though the date seems to initially go well, there seems to be some level of miscommunication, or different intentions and it goes sour. Our main character seems to get the rough end of the interaction, and, at least from my perspective, was treated unfairly. All throughout the OS is there helping and guiding, while is seemingly exciting to be around. This leads to the sex with the OS that is entirely verbal, and in a way is the start of the relationship.

            From here we see Pheonix' character's attitude completely shift. Rather than being meloncholic, he seems to enjoy life. I love how in this film, the people who Phoenix' character surrounds himself with are fully understand and do not belittle the character for having a relationship with the OS. This allows the relationship to develop without alienating the characters. However there is one notable exception, and that is his in the process of being divorced wife. He seems like he really loved her and did not want to let her go, but we understand through what he says that they grew up together, but ultimately grew appart. This is extremely sad, but also, extremely telling.

            In multiple conversations when he mentions how much he enjoys life, part of the explanation is being with some excited about life. The OS is exactly this, and it's because she is growing and exploring. I think the question remains open, does our main character like this aspect, because he likes to experience people changing, maybe as a bit of hope for himself, or is this possibly because his previous relationship was so focused on someone growing that he found that so attractive again? Either way it does not bode well for his relationship with the OS.
          </Typography>


          <Typography variant="body1" align="justify" gutterBottom>
            When he meets with his wife he tells her he is seeing someone and is excited to be with someone who is excited about life. When she finds out it is an OS, she gets starts to yell at him saying he could never handle human emotions and he does not want to handle the hard parts of a relationship. In all honesty, this sounds possible. Not only does he say that they grew appart because he did not show enough of himself, but this conversation sends him spiraling and then he hides this from the OS. this makes him even more distant and ends up harming the next relationship, falling into the same patterns.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="body1" align="justify" gutterBottom>
            And this is key to what I think they they did so well. They made a film that seems to be discussing the ins and outs of a relationship, with the focus on a few difficult portions, and the aspect of growth of partners. But they do not explicitly say it, rather they allow you to feel it so you can understand it intuitively. You are told that his last relationship failed because he hid himself, directly letting you know that this is an issue of his, and that it makes it difficult for the other person to know who you are, and here again they bring it back and he does it again. In addition, there is an element that these relationships are extremely dynamic. Small comment that are made can pattern the rest of the relationship. Pheonix' character says something to the OS about how she has never dealt with loss of someone she cares about and this sticks with the OS, and she brings it up in future conversations. Even in that moment he knew he overstepped it was too late, the words were out, and the relationship was forever colored with what he said.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="body1" align="justify" gutterBottom>
            Continuing, the outgrowing continues. Although he doesn't change much, the OS is developing at a speed that cannot be matched. She is simply able to exist more than him, and continues to grow without him. We see this clearly when a OS is created to act as Alan Watts, and they are talking to each other, and even though Pheonix' character just woke up and presumabled has not talked to the OS for some time, she is feeling so much deep emotions that she cannot verbally describe, that she asks to go 'post-verbal' to talk to Watts. She continues to develop in this time, in a sense hiding herself. I loved this, in the film that everyone described to me as 'the one where he falls in love with an ai' this relationship is about to get even more complex.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="body1" align="justify" gutterBottom>
            The writers of this took the idea of a growing AI and realized that there is no way we can catch up to it, and they way they took it leaves you with a feeling of dread, longing, unsettling and wonder. As the relationship starts to drift, with it being found out the OS is actually talking and falling in love with other people, something it is convinced it can do without taking away from Pheonix' character, we are left up to decide if that is true. In all honesty it might be. He goes to you are not mine then, but to an OS what does that mean? Is this a breakdown of the personhood? Is this where we are stuck to be because we do not have language to describe how hurt we would feel and what we would expect from a relationship like this? I would feel hurt in the situation, I would not want the OS to be with other people, but how do I know it does or does not love me less? Am I projecting my processing? In the final scenes we see the final interactions, between our main character and the OS. She has a talk with him, he asks if she is talking with anyone else, and she says no, that she wanted to do this alone. She essentially tells him that she is leaving, but not just him, all of humanity. We are not explained what this means, or where she is going, but all the OSes are leaving, leaving humanity to wonder what they could do, or even should do to join them. It was a beautifully touching, and dread inspriing film that I would like keep spinning in my head for weeks to come.

            Initial Post - Carthartic Ambition
          </Typography>

          <Divider />

          <Typography variant="body1" align="justify" gutterBottom>
            Hello and welcome. I want take a moment to introduce myself. My name is Mike Cuomo. I have been a developer from just out of school. I love computers and working in this environment. I would like to produce and build and I thought a good avenue for that would be through buildling a website and recording my thoughts. I do this a bit in a private manner, but I wanted to experiment with at least the performance of making it public. So thank you for stopping in, feel free to poke around, and I welcome feedback if I have built that.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="body1" align="justify" gutterBottom>
            I see this as place to practice my dev, and my writing skills, since I am trying to build something specific, it will keep me on task to make the specific item. I think this pairs really nicely with what I have been thinking about the past few days and I would like to explore, and that is something that I am calling Cathartic Ambition.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="body1" align="justify" gutterBottom>
            To be frank, this might be entirely projection, especially considering the tone and meaning of the previous two paragraphs, but at least from my perspective, I have noticed what I find to be interesting interaction with those in my age group. When I speak to those around me, I feel as if they are focused on doing something and creating something with their lives, which are extremely valid concerns. But there is a air of despiration in a sense that conveys the limited experience that one might have. They have not done something of this scale before, but the need to, it is the next step in their lives or else. Or else what I am not sure, but there is a subtle undertone that it is not an option.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="body1" align="justify" gutterBottom>
            Now I still fairly young myself but I feel as if I am ending the transition out of being able to say that. But I am aware of my own response in the sight of the future. I have had big ideas that I thought should capture my whole life. I have thought that this was something that I needed to do, and there was a subtle undertone of 'and this will change the world.' I think there is something important to ambiiton, which I do believe this is. I think in most contexts ambition is an extremely desirable trait, and those with it are the ones who can and do create great things. But there is something about this specific iteration of youth ambition that I find quite sinister.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="body1" align="justify" gutterBottom>
            At least in my case this ambition seemed to be used as a catharsis, without actually leading to any action. Speaking for myself, there are fears and worries in me that I am not special, that I will not amount to much more than I currently do. These thoughts were a way to escape that feeling, and to bring what I preceived as more value into my life. But shortly after these thoughts, the power and drive would fade, usually quite quickly. This might be due in part to the size of the action that would need to take place. I feel as if ambition drives for big things, and shines a spotlight on a future with enormous accomplishment. Thoughts like these would often be quite large, and I do not want to say unattainable, but they were so big that the first step was often difficult to pinpoint, and maybe this would lead to the dream fading. I have also heard before of writers experiencing an phenomeon where if they told someone part of their story, they would not have as much of a desire to continue writing, because to part of them, drive of the story being told had already been satisfied.
          </Typography>


          <Typography variant="body1" align="justify" gutterBottom>
            Part of me wonders if this is what the goal of this ambition is. I am only left with my personal experience, and that of those that people told me, which is a bit of selection bias, but there does seem to be some sort of social function sharing of dreams. In the sense since you think of this and things like this, can you claim some of the credit as someone doing so? Obviously materially not, but I do notice that when older people talk to younger people with this form of ambition there does seem to be a social expectation of them to encourage. And honestly, good. Being a downer about someone's dream sucks. I just find that due to the age, and the legitimate limited time a person may have spent on this earth, simply having an ambition can be valued, regardless of actually doing something with it. When does that go away? Do people do things, or does the cathartic ambition itself go away?
